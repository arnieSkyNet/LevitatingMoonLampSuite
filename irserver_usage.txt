Usage: irserver [options] <device>

The last argument for the irserver is always the device:
Windows Devices: COM1 - COMn or USB for USB devices

LINUX Devices: /dev/ttyS0 - /dev/ttySn or /dev/ttyUSB0 - /dev/ttyUSBn for USB devices
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description of the options:

-baudrate <bd>  The baudrate to be used when communicating with RS232 devices.

-no_reconnect   The server will not try to reconnect to a device once it
                was removed. Standard is that the server tries to reconnect
                when the device was removed when the server was running.
                (USB only)

-no_lirc        The LIRC compatible Server socket ist not started. That
                allows to run LIRC on the same PC.

-debug_code     All received IR codes are printed on the console. When the
                code is found in the database the Remote/Command is printed,
                too. The loglevel 4 has to be used to activated that output.

-timestamp      Add a timestamp to every log message.

-medialon       Make a hexdump of sent commands in a format for the Medialon SW.

-hexdump        The server prints the complete communication between client
                and server. This can be used to debug codes or to record
                the communication to use the IRTrans with other systems.
			   
-xap            Start the integrated xap interface.

-ip_relay       Relay IR Codes received from an Ethernet module to connected
                USB, RS232 or bus modules.

-hexfile <file> The server prints the complete communication between client
                and server into <file>. This can be used to record the 
                communication to use the IRTrans with other systems.

-codedump       The IR Data of all command sent is printed to the console.
                The loglevel 4 has to be used to activate the output.

-stat_timeout	Sets the timeout (in s) after that the Cache for the device status
                is reread from the devices.

-learned_only   Only Codes that have been learned are transmitted to the
                Network clients. NOTE: This option will become default
                in later versions of the irserver.

-logfile <file> Redirect the console/log output to a specified file.

-loglevel <x>   Controls which information is logged. Standard is loglevel 1.
                Possible values are 0-4. 0=Nothing is logged. 4=debug output.

-netmask <mask> Access control for networked clients. When this option is used
                at least once, only clients within the specified netmask are
                allowed to access the Server. The format is ip/bits. That
                means 192.168.12.0/24 defines a standard class C network.
                This option can be used more then once to define different
                networks. A single host can be defined with IP/32. The defined
                netmasks are used for all IRTrans and LIRC clients.

-udp_relay      Switches on the UDP Relay of received commands to custom servers.
<host> <port>   <host> is name or IP-Adress of the remote server. <port> is
<format>        the UDP port used for the relay. The format string defines the
                format which is used to send the commands: %r will be replaced
                with the Remote control; %c will be replaced with the command
                and %a will be replaced with the IRTrans Device Adress. Static
                strings can be added as needed.
                NOTE: This option can be used to connect to remote servers that
                do not know the IRTrans or LIRC protocol. They only need to be
                able to receive definable UDP telegrams.

-no_clock       Do not start the Clock on a connected Display module when the
                irserver is shut down.

-start_clock    Start the clock on a connected Display module when the irserver
                is started.

-lcd <type>     Defines the display type of a LCD display connected to the
                serial bus: Type = 1: 20 x 4; Type = 2: 40 x 4

-http_port <x>  Defines the TCP/IP port to be used for the integrated Webserver.
                Only if this option is used the Webserver will be started !

-pidfile <file> Write the PID of the irserver to the path/file

-daemon         Starts the irserver as a LINUX Service. If no -logfile option
                is present, irserver.log in the current directory is used.
                THIS OPTION IS VALID FOR LINUX ONLY !

-set_id <id>    Sets the device ID for a 2nd generation IRTrans module. This
                option can be used to set the ID for the IRTrans module
                connected directly to the server. It is only valid for the
                2nd generation RS232/USB modules that no longer have a
                DIP switch to set the ID.
                THIS OPTION WILL NOT START THE SERVER. IT ONLY SETS THE ID!
